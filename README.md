## About OSE
<b>Open Smart Environment software is a suite for creating
multi-instance applications that work as a single whole.</b><br>
Imagine, for example, a personal mesh running on various devices
including HTPCs, phones, tablets, workstations, servers, Raspberry
Pis, home automation gadgets, wearables, drones, etc.

OSE software consists of several npm packages: a [framework](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#framework) running
on Node.js, an [HTML5 frontend](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#html5frontend), extending
packages and a set of example applications.

**Set-up of current example applications.** Here,
OSE provides a [Media player](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#example-player) running on an HTPC
that can be controlled by an IR remote through
[LIRC](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#example-lirc) and is capable of playing streams from a
[DVB streamer](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#example-dvb) and control devices through GPIO
pins on a [Raspberry Pi](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#example-rpi)

For more information about OSE see **[the documentation](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/)**.

to understand the basic principles covered by the
[documentation](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/).

However, this software is successfully and continuously used since end
of 2013 in one installation running 7 OSE instances spread over several
Raspberries, HTPC and notebook.

## Platforms
